# AGENTIC-AI

Agentic AI
Building intelligent, autonomous agents with LangGraph and LangChain.

Overview
Agentic AI is a project that leverages the power of LangGraph and LangChain to create intelligent, autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This project aims to demonstrate how to build scalable, modular, and efficient AI agents for various applications, such as task automation, decision-making, and natural language processing.

Features

Modular Agent Architecture: Build reusable and customizable agent workflows using LangGraph.
Natural Language Processing: Utilize LangChain for advanced language model integrations and prompt engineering.
Scalable Design: Easily extend the system to incorporate new tools, APIs, or agent behaviors.
Task Automation: Automate repetitive tasks with intelligent decision-making capabilities.
Customizable Prompts: Fine-tune agent responses with dynamic prompt templates.
Open Source: Freely available for contributions and community-driven development.


Tech Stack

LangGraph: For building stateful, graph-based agent workflows.
LangChain: For integrating language models and managing prompts, tools, and memory.
Python: Core programming language for the project.


Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-ai.git
cd agentic-ai


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys (e.g., for OpenAI, if used):
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key


Run the Project:
python main.py




Usage

Basic Example:Run the example script to see a simple agent in action:
python examples/simple_agent.py


Customizing Agents:Modify the agent configuration in config/agent_config.yaml to adjust behavior, tools, or prompts.

Extending Functionality:Add new nodes to the LangGraph workflow in src/workflows/ to create custom agent behaviors.


Example of running a task:
from src.agent import AgenticAI

agent = AgenticAI(config_path="config/agent_config.yaml")
response = agent.run_task("Summarize this document: [path/to/document]")
print(response)
